<h1>I Can Share</h1>
<p>
The era of separation is evolving. If all of you are my reflection and
I am yours, we are the same energy. We are
TRANSFORMATION. Events are manifestations of energy.
I am this unique, personal, wonderful universe. I transcend all
separation to be individual and also unique organism with all of you.
We are the dawn of a new evolutionary phase, a flowering beyond
imagination. I embrace reality for what it is. Through separation we
generated competition to produce progress, which gave birth to the
digital network with which we connect and STRUCTURE
SHARING. We share and marvel at happiness and well-being. We
infect, revealing that SHARING IS A RITUAL OF CARE AND
GRATITUDE,
IN
ABSENCE
OF
JUDGMENT
AND
EXPECTATIONS.
I share time to transform your home. I share a part of the harvest,
which I transport by passing as I come to help you. I share a bottle of
wine on the beach, sourdough, seeds. I share for a night this home. I
welcome you for who you are. I welcome me for who I am. Our words
accompany each other. Our eyes compose the vision. In the seed of
transformation each event in history acquires the interpretation of
natural necessity and each encounter expands us.
We are generating a new social structure, a new dimension of
existence, without boundaries, without weapons. Having to be is
transformed into being. We recognize ourselves because we SMILE
and say THANK YOU. We care for the earth, we celebrate, we
transcend, we become ART.Project: I CAN SHARE
-Purpose: To care for the planet, cultivating the energy of sharing,
generating real aggregation, art, transformation
personal and social.
-Strategy: generate an information network, integrally devoid of
the energy of exchange and hierarchies, that unites places and
people,
In sharing and art. A completely innovative social that
aggregates in real life. The way of collaborating in the realization
of the project is experimental and springs from the encounter, in
the mode of cooperation where each point of view is legitimate
and unites to form the vision, in the present moment, without
expectations.
Implementation steps: 1 organize operational areas ( audiovisual,
popularization, computer programming...); 2 making videos;
3 realize website; 4 crowdfunding; 5 aggregate people,
communities, free media organs; 6 organize outreach and
fundraising events; 7 realize and disseminate computer network,
app
-
App I CAN SHARE
Purpose: To connect people and places to generate a virtual
community that can manifest in real life.
The principle of community, understood as a physical place, separate
from the rest, i s transformed into a global, open network, in complete
harmony with social reality.
The app may have the following structure:
Signing up with Facebook or other identification
• THE PROJECT.
--description
--support the project
--chronology, contributions and expenses
• I EXPRESS A NEED
--expressing a need for objects
--I express a need for help
--expressing a need for displacement• SHARE
-- I support a need
--sharing time
--sharing objects
--sharing place
--- by experience, food, art, meditation
---for rest, refuge
--share displacement (interaction with google mapss, the app alerts
me to the possibility of sharing a displacement when I enter a
destination)
---transportation of objects
---transporting people
• I SAY THANK YOU
--I say thank you
--support the projectAll this is an idea. The project is dream, and the definition of actions
to be taken can be inspirational and accelerate the process, even
generating totally different and unexpected actions.
Events of violence between peoples are the most extreme
manifestation of a social system that is based on the energy of
separation. Separation occurred at the dawn of human civilizations as
an opportunity for survival and evolved with the energy of exchange.
Our way of processing thoughts, of deciphering reality, feeds and is
fed by this complex layering in the making. In exchange, the abilities
to remember and program are valuable, and competition has resulted
in extraordinary things accomplished by humankind, manifesting itself
in the most extreme and opposing forms, but it has also revealed the
urgency to evolve to preserve our habitat. If we choose to decipher all
this, as an evolutionary stage of a single organism, we recognize the
perfection of the present moment and each event that has determined
it. Our way of deciphering reality creates reality and generates its
potentialities. If our dream today is a humanity that protects the planet,
without violence, evolving and flourishing in unity and cooperation,
the only way is to welcome the world as it is, as a part of ourselves
and ourselves as part of the whole. If I exclude that a part of the field
belongs to me, distancing myself from it, I cannot transform it, I
cannot transform myself.
We are energy, one field. As much as our senses do not perceive all
aspects of the process, transformational energy is every movement,
every gene that joins at conception, every word written or spoken,
every thought, every elementary particle.
We are energy and, in transcendence, we have the power to direct the
rudder of transformation, generating the dream. Art, by its nature,
unites us beyond all patterns and polarizes creativity.
If I embrace the whole field as part of me, I become aware of the
power I am to transform reality by transforming myself. I disrupt the
whole field and the intention creates reality as a projection of the
energy that I am. If I cultivate the energy of sharing and spread
awareness of how this generates transformation,What may appear as a crazy dream magically manifests itself. Today
the conditions are in place for this to happen. When three American
students were designing Facebook, they had no idea that they would
change the way people think and generate the conditions for further
transformation. Using social to date we have cultivated different
qualities of energy. We have traded time for social approval,
symbolized by likes, but sometimes we have also shared according to
the expectation-free meaning of the term. Now the idea is to create a
social structured solely on the energy of sharing, understood only as
caring in the absence of judgment and expectations, offering the
possibility that this will manifest in real life, in aggregation, clearly
and unequivocally spreading its nature and potential, even on existing
socials. In the absence of judgment, it is not the quantity of what is
shared that matters, but the quality of the ritual, the recognizing when
this energy spontaneously manifests.
We grew up in a system structured on separation and layered the
belief that it is the only one possible, too entrenched to contemplate
the possibility of transformation. A trivial virus metaphorically
revealed to us that every system contemplates a possible bug. The
events of future history will be manifestations of the energy that, now,
we choose to cultivate.
The dream is beyond the idea of a new generation of socials, it is to
accelerate the process of collective awareness, spreading the idea that
this is possible simply by recognizing the essence of this energy
already present in each of us. I dream of a network without borders,
uniting individuals, groups, communities, devoid of bureaucracy, one
that values time and solidarity and can be inspirational. The beauty is
that, in the absence of competition, I address gratitude and support for
those who want to be inspired by this idea and implement it, anywhere
in the world. The world is full of people who cultivate the energy of
sharing and places where this happens. If making it possible to unite
all this energy is a dream, let it manifest.
